      Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and Order Books are two different types of
      systems for executing trades. An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a type of
      decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that allows traders to trade
      cryptocurrencies and other digital assets without an order book or an
      intermediary.


      AMMs offer many benefits over order books.

      AMMs provide liquidity to traders with always available prices, while
      order books require both buyer and seller to agree on a price leading to
      low liquidity for some assets.

      AMMs do not need order matching, using a mathematical formula for price
      discovery based on the asset ratio in the pool.
