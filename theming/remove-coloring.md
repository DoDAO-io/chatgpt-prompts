- "--primary-color" -  this variable needs to be used for some primary actions like buttons etc. 
- "--bg-color" - should be applied as backgorund color for body
- "--text-color" - color of the text
- "--link-color" - color for anchor tags or buttons which which look like links
- "--heading-color" - color for h1, h2, h3 etc headings
- "--border-color" - border color
- "--header-bg" - backforund color of the header
- "--block-bg" - background color of larger divs or sections, or containers

Please use styled components to keep the new classes within the component

Write all the code in typescript as use types wherever possible and use them to make the code more explicit.
