What is a savings account?
A savings account is a basic type of financial product that allows you to deposit your money and typically earn a modest amount of interest. These accounts are federally insured up to $250,000 per account owner and offer a safe place to put your money while earning interest.

You can find savings accounts at banks and credit unions. You don’t need a large amount of money to open a savings account, and you’ll also have easy access to your money, though you may be limited in how many times you can access that money each month.

Why you need a savings account
A savings account is a good place to keep money for a later date, separate from everyday spending cash, because of their safety, liquidity and interest-earning potential. These accounts are a great place for your emergency fund or savings for shorter-term goals, like a vacation or home repair.

Beyond quick access to your cash when you need it, savings accounts often offer higher interest rates than checking accounts. You might even find some savings accounts with a higher APY than money market accounts. The average APY on savings accounts is just 0.19 percent, but you can find high-yield savings accounts paying over 4 percent.

Finally, there are many opportunities to open a savings account with low fees. You can often find simple options to avoid pesky maintenance fees.

How does a savings account work?
You will open a savings account at a bank or credit union, either online or in person. The process is similar to opening a checking account. You will provide the institution with personal information and then deposit money into the account.

Once you’ve made a deposit, the money in your savings account will begin to earn interest. The amount earned depends on a few factors, including your savings account APY, the amount of money you deposit and how long you keep money in your account.

Your bank may choose to compound interest on a daily, monthly, quarterly or yearly basis. At the end of each compounding period, your accrued interest is deposited into your account. From there, your new account balance (deposits plus interest) will begin earning interest.

For example, let’s say that you made an initial deposit of $10,000, and your bank compounds interest annually. With a 0.1 percent APY, you’d earn about $10 in interest for the year. However, with a high-yield savings account APY of 4 percent, you’d make about $400 for the year. Then, your new balance (either $10,010 or $10,400) would start to earn interest. If you have a shorter compounding period, your money will grow even faster.

Your savings account APY is variable and can change at any time. You can move money out of the account whenever you want, but many institutions limit the amount of withdrawals you can make from a savings account to six per month.
